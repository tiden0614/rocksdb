/**
 * Enum DbPathUseStrategy
 *
 * RocksDB supports using multiple paths for storing its data files.
 * Currently there are two ways of using these paths:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>RESPECT_TARGET_SIZE</strong> - Fill DbPaths according
 *   to the target size set with the db path. Newer data is placed into
 *   paths specified earlier in the vector while older data gradually
 *   moves to paths specified later in the vector.
 *   <br/>
 *   For example, you have a flash device with 10GB allocated for the DB,
 *   as well as a hard drive of 2TB, you should config it to be:
 *     [{"/flash_path", 10GB}, {"/hard_drive", 2TB}]
 *   <br/>
 *   The system will try to guarantee data under each path is close to but
 *   not larger than the target size. But current and future file sizes used
 *   by determining where to place a file are based on best-effort estimation,
 *   which means there is a chance that the actual size under the directory
 *   is slightly more than target size under some workloads. User should give
 *   some buffer room for those cases.
 *   <br/>
 *   If none of the paths has sufficient room to place a file, the file will
 *   be placed to the last path anyway, despite to the target size.
 *   <br/>
 *   Placing newer data to earlier paths is also best-efforts. User should
 *   expect user files to be placed in higher levels in some extreme cases.
 *   </li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>RANDOMLY_CHOOSE_PATH</strong> - Randomly distribute files
 *   into the list of db paths.
 *   <br/>
 *   For example, you have a few data drives on your host that are mounted
 *   as [/sdb1, /sdc1, /sdd1, /sde1]. Say that the database will create 6
 *   table files -- 0[0-5].sst, then they will end up on in these places:
 *   <br/>
 *   /sdb1/02.sst <br/>
 *   /sdb1/04.sst <br/>
 *   /sdc1/05.sst <br/>
 *   /sdc1/03.sst <br/>
 *   /sdd1/00.sst <br/>
 *   /sde1/01.sst <br/>
 *   <br/>
 *   This is useful if you want the database to equally use all the disks
 *   (such that you can stop worrying about moving data around hosts to
 *   avoid a single host having a full disk).
 *   <br/>
 *   Note that the target_size attr in DbPath will not be useful if this
 *   strategy is chosen.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
